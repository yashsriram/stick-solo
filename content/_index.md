- This project illustrates a few methods for natural climbing-motion synthesis for 2D stick-figure agents.
- Climbing can be divided into sequence of hold-to-hold movements.
- Uses a distance cost function based gradient descent as a baseline.
- Introduces angle constrains and center-of-mass term for more natural motion.
- Explores sample-based methods to prune local minima.
- Illustrates the need and power of learning-based neck-position prediction for a two-arm agent.
